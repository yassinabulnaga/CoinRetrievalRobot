#  Coin Retrieval Robot

A second-year mechatronics project at UBC for the course **ELEC291**, involving the design and construction of a robot capable of retrieving metallic coins in both autonomous and manual modes using a PS2-controlled wireless interface. For more details, see PDFs -> Project 2 Report

##  1. System Overview

###  1.1 Hardware System Overview

This robot was designed as a dual-layer autonomous and manual coin retrieval system. Key subsystems include:

- **Colpitts Oscillator** â€“ For real-time metal detection via frequency shift.
- **Electromagnet + Servo** â€“ Used to pick up and release metallic coins.
- **IR Sensors** â€“ Detect arena boundaries to prevent robot escape.
- **LCD Screen** â€“ Displays real-time coin count and status messages.
- **Dual-layer Breadboard Stack** â€“ Hosts STM32 microcontroller and logic circuitry.
- **PS2 Remote + JDY-40 Module** â€“ Enables wireless control through a PIC32-based transmitter.

###  1.3 Remote Controller Overview

Built around a **PIC32MX130F064B**, this handheld device provides real-time robot control and feedback:

- **PS2 Controller Input** â€” Reads analog stick and button data for control.
- **16x2 LCD Display** â€” Shows coin count and metal detection strength.
- **Speaker Output** â€” Beeps in proportion to metal signal strength.
- **JDY-40 Bluetooth** â€” Sends command packets to the robot, requests telemetry.

##  2. Communication Protocol

| Symbol | Meaning                       | Notes                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `!`    | Start of command              | Followed by 6-character PS2 data      |
| `@`    | Data request from remote     | Robot replies with signal + coin data |

Command format: `[b1][b2][RX][RY][LX][LY]`, where:
- `b1`, `b2` = button codes (e.g. `X`, `O`, `L`, `R`)
- Joysticks encoded as `'1'`â€“`'9'` based on analog position

Robot responds with: `xxxxxcc` â†’ `xxxxx` = signal strength, `cc` = coin count

##  3. Features & Capabilities

###  Core Features
- Dual mode operation: **manual** (PS2 joystick) and **autonomous** (FSM-driven)
- Metal detection using Colpitts oscillator + ADC logic
- Perimeter detection using wire-induced signal pickup
- Wireless serial communication over JDY-40 Bluetooth
- Coin pickup with servo arm and electromagnet

###  Bonus Features
- PS2-based input for intuitive controls
- LCD live telemetry (coin count, signal strength)
- Speaker feedback that increases beeping with signal
- Pause/resume support in autonomous mode
- 90Â° precision turns (L3/R3)
- Inch forward/backward (R1/R2)
- Semi-automated pickup (L2)

##  4. Testing & Calibration

###  Oscilloscope Tuning â€“ Colpitts Oscillator (Metal Detection)

Two oscilloscope snapshots were taken to verify the oscillatorâ€™s output waveform and assess how the signal changes in the presence of nearby metal.

###  ADC Voltage Threshold Calibration â€“ Perimeter Detection

The graph below shows analog readings from two perimeter sensor coils, captured via the STM32â€™s ADC. A voltage spike is clearly observed when the robot nears the perimeter wire.
