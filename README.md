## ðŸ§  1. System Overview

### ðŸ”© 1.1 Hardware System Overview

This robot was designed as a dual-layer autonomous and manual coin retrieval system. Key subsystems include:

- **Colpitts Oscillator** â€“ For real-time metal detection via frequency shift.
- **Electromagnet + Servo** â€“ Used to pick up and release metallic coins.
- **IR Sensors** â€“ Detect arena boundaries to prevent robot escape.
- **LCD Screen** â€“ Displays real-time coin count and status messages.
- **Dual-layer Breadboard Stack** â€“ Hosts STM32 microcontroller and logic circuitry.
- **PS2 Remote + JDY-40 Module** â€“ Enables wireless control through a PIC32-based transmitter.

The embedded firmware and remote control software were designed to work in tandem:

- **Robot (STM32)**:
  - Finite State Machine (FSM) for autonomous control
  - PWM-based drive system and servo control
  - ADC-based metal detection
  - UART-based communication with remote

- **Remote (PIC32)**:
  - PS2 joystick input interpretation
  - LCD coin tracking feedback
  - UART command transmission via JDY-40
