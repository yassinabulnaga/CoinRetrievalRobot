## ðŸ§  1. System Overview

### ðŸ”© 1.1 Hardware System Overview

This robot was designed as a dual-layer autonomous and manual coin retrieval system. Key subsystems include:

- **Colpitts Oscillator** â€“ For real-time metal detection via frequency shift.
- **Electromagnet + Servo** â€“ Used to pick up and release metallic coins.
- **IR Sensors** â€“ Detect arena boundaries to prevent robot escape.
- **LCD Screen** â€“ Displays real-time coin count and status messages.
- **Dual-layer Breadboard Stack** â€“ Hosts STM32 microcontroller and logic circuitry.
- **PS2 Remote + JDY-40 Module** â€“ Enables wireless control through a PIC32-based transmitter.

### ðŸ›œ 1.3 Remote Hardware Overview

The wireless remote controller was built around a **PIC32 microcontroller** with the following components:

- **PS2 Joystick Module** â€“ Captures X/Y directional input for manual robot movement.
- **JDY-40 Bluetooth Module** â€“ Facilitates UART-based wireless communication to the robot.
- **LCD Display (16x2)** â€“ Shows live coin count and connection status.
- **4 Push Buttons** â€“ Customizable inputs for mode switching and manual servo control.
- **3.3V Regulator + Discrete Power Circuitry** â€“ Supplies clean voltage for logic and peripherals.

This modular and hand-held system was designed to mimic a basic gaming controller while displaying relevant feedback to the user.

### ðŸ’¡ 1.4 Remote Software Overview

The remote firmware was written in C for the PIC32 architecture and includes:

- **PS2 Joystick Input Parser** â€“ Reads analog joystick values and translates them into movement commands.
- **UART Packet Protocol** â€“ Encodes commands (movement, servo control) into structured packets and transmits them over JDY-40 Bluetooth.
- **LCD Update Handler** â€“ Dynamically refreshes coin count and robot status (autonomous/manual, ready/error).
- **Debounced Button Input** â€“ Ensures reliable mode switching without false triggering.
- **Mode Selector Logic** â€“ Allows user to toggle between autonomous and manual robot modes.

The remote and robot communicate at 9600 baud and maintain a lightweight command-response structure for real-time responsiveness.

The embedded firmware and remote control software were designed to work in tandem:

- **Robot (STM32)**:
  - Finite State Machine (FSM) for autonomous control
  - PWM-based drive system and servo control
  - ADC-based metal detection
  - UART-based communication with remote

- **Remote (PIC32)**:
  - PS2 joystick input interpretation
  - LCD coin tracking feedback
  - UART command transmission via JDY-40
